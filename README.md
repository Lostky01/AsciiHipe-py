# AsciiHipe-py

This is a simple string chiper concept made entirely with python
if youre asking, whats with the wo ai ni? is this some love story bullshit?
nah lol, you can change it though it purposefully made for showing a specific condition on the loop


# String Chiper
First of all, you must understand what a string chiper is
no, its not important for your life and have no use in real life
basically string chiper is a method on how you can encrypt your text with each letter incremented to a specific value depends on how much you wanna go
Convert the letter into the number that matches its order in the alphabet starting from 0, and call this number Y.
(A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Y=24, Z=25)
basically an encryption, readable and understandable one, if you can read it, lol

# Ascii Converter
After you inputted the required text and encryption chiper value, the system will convert each letter to your desired value, then convert it to ascii, then convert it again to readable text

# Why the fuck does it so complicated?? can you just make a normal string cipher converter without all the ascii thing?
its my code so i dont give a fuck lmao
